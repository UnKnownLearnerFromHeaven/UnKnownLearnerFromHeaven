### Hey, this is my previous account which I used to use for my learning process, even if I didn't need to push anything to github while I was reading and researching more. btw, at some point in time, I've decided to have a more _specific_ or in better word _sophisticated_ account for my projects other than backend _things_ and created [lyteabovenyte](https://github.com/lyteabovenyte) which argubaly I shouldn't or maybe should.
